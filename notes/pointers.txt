(int *) some_array - casts the array to a an array of integers

int *points_start = (int *)points;


Arrays decay which means that the name becomes just a pointer to the first element

When Arrays decay - when used in expressions containing pointers

int arr[5]
int *ptr = arr; // arr decays to int*
int value = *(arr+2) // arr decays to int*

When arrays are passed to functions they decay to a pointer as opposed to passing a struct to a function which is passed by value.

When arrays do not decay:
- sizeof operator: returns the size of the entire array sizeof(arr)
- & operator: Taking the address of an array with &arr gives you a pointer to the whole array not just the first element. 
  - &arr is a pointer to the array type e.g. int (*)[5]
- intialization: When an array is declared and intitialized, it is fully allocated in memory and does not decay to a pointer.
