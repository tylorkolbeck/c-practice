µnit is a small but full-\/featured unit testing framework for C. It has no dependencies (beyond libc), is permissively licensed (MIT), and is easy to include into any project.

For more information, see \href{https://nemequ.github.io/munit}{\texttt{ the µnit web site}}.

Features µnit currently includes include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Handy assertion macros which make for nice error messages.
\item Reproducible cross-\/platform random number generation, including support for supplying a seed via CLI.
\item Timing of both wall-\/clock and CPU time.
\item Parameterized tests.
\item Nested test suites.
\item Flexible CLI.
\item Forking (\href{https://github.com/nemequ/munit/issues/2}{\texttt{ except on Windows}}).
\item Hiding output of successful tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Features µnit does not currently include, but some day may include (a.\+k.\+a., if you file a PR…), include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://testanything.org/}{\texttt{ TAP}} support; feel free to discuss in \href{https://github.com/nemequ/munit/issues/1}{\texttt{ issue \#1}}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_includes_munit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Include into your project with meson}\label{md_includes_munit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In your {\ttfamily subprojects} folder put a {\ttfamily munit.\+wrap} file containing\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[wrap-\/git]}
\DoxyCodeLine{directory=munit}
\DoxyCodeLine{url=https://github.com/nemequ/munit/}
\DoxyCodeLine{revision=head}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then you can use a subproject fallback when you include munit as a dependency to your project\+: `dependency(\textquotesingle{}munit', fallback\+: \mbox{[}\textquotesingle{}munit\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}munit\+\_\+dep\textquotesingle{}\mbox{]})\`{}\hypertarget{md_includes_munit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{md_includes_munit__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
